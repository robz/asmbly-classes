# asmbly-classes

This is the public class listing and registration site for [Asmbly Makerspace](https://asmbly.org), served at [classes.asmbly.org](https://classes.asmbly.org).

Members browse + waitlist + request classes, and are routed to Neon to register for classes. There's also a WIP page where users can authenticate with Neon in order to cancel class registration. Class data is sourced from Neon CRM and kept in sync via a scheduled job.

## Tech stack overview

- **Web app**: SvelteKit on the Node adapter, Vite, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
- **Hosting**: AWS App Runner (web app), AWS Lambda with EventBridge (recurring jobs written in node)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS, accessed via Prisma; both the app and recurring jobs connect to it via the same DSN (`DATABASE_URL` on App Runner, SSM `/classes-db/dsn` on Lambda) and share the same Prisma schema
- **Email**: Nodemailer (Gmail SMTP)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions → AWS ECR → App Runner / Lambda

## Web app

Runs on **AWS App Runner**, which auto-pulls the `classes-page` image from ECR on each push to `main`. App Runner handles HTTPS at `classes.asmbly.org`, and routes traffic to the SvelteKit Node server (port 3000).

Routes (`app/src/routes/(data-pages)/`):
- `/` — search and filter all visible classes (category, sort, group-by-type)
- `/event/[eventTypeId]` — class detail page with all upcoming instances
- `/my-classes` — WIP: Neon CRM OAuth flow that lets users view their registrations and request cancellations

Internal API:
- `POST /api/class-registration` — Neon webhook; bumps attendee count; marks the registrant's own waitlist request as fulfilled if they had one
- `POST /api/class-cancellation` — Neon webhook; decrements attendee count; emails all waitlist requesters about the open seat (first-come-first-served)

## Recurring jobs

`cron-service/` is packaged as a Lambda container image, deployed to the `classes-crons` Lambda function, and invoked from AWS EventBridge (it is no longer actually a cron job). The handler reads `cronType` from the event payload and dispatches:

| `cronType`                | Schedule (CT)        | What it does                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hourlyClassMaintenance`  | Every hour, :30      | Pulls active events from Neon, upserts instances, prunes deleted events      |
| `weeklyReportingMetrics`  | Sunday 07:00         | Emails `classes@asmbly.org` a digest of waitlist / on-demand / notify requests |

Secrets are pulled at runtime from AWS SSM Parameter Store.

**Note on schema duplication:** `cron-service/prisma/schema.prisma` and `cron-service/prisma/migrations/` are byte-identical copies of the ones under `app/prisma/` so the cron image can run `prisma generate` at build time. Schema changes have to be copied into both folders, or the Lambdas will silently go stale.

## Database

Defined in `app/prisma/schema.prisma`:

- `NeonEventType` — class template (e.g. "Woodworking 101")
- `NeonEventInstance` — a specific scheduled session (date, teacher, capacity, price)
- `NeonEventCategory`/`AsmblyArchCategory` — categories for classes, Arch being more general (CNC Router -> Woodworking)
- `NeonEventTeacher` — instructor records
- `NeonEventInstanceRequest` — waitlist for a specific instance
- `NeonEventTypeRequest` — "notify me when scheduled" / on-demand requests for a type
- `NeonEventRequester` — email/name of a requester
- `NeonEventInstanceCancellee` — tracks who has cancelled (prevents double-decrement)
- `User` + `Session` — local auth records keyed by `neon_id`

Migrations live in `app/prisma/migrations/` and are applied by `prisma migrate deploy` at container startup, so DB migrations are applied on every deploy.

## Local development

See [`dev/README.md`](dev/README.md) for setting up the website to run locally.

## App scripts

Run from `app/`. Other scripts in `package.json` are container-internal or unused.

| Script           | Purpose                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run lint`   | Prettier check + ESLint                                   |
| `npm run format` | Prettier write                                            |
| `npm test`       | Vitest (currently only a placeholder test)                |
| `npm run dev`    | Vite dev server — usually invoked by `dev/load-dev-db.sh` |

## Environment variables

The webapp expects the following (referenced from `app/src/lib/server/secrets.js` and route handlers). In production these are set on the App Runner service; in local dev, set them in your shell or in `app/.env`. Note that the recurring Lambda jobs do not read these from `.env`; they pull equivalents from SSM at invocation time.

**Database**
- `DATABASE_URL` — Prisma connection string (RDS endpoint in prod; the local Postgres URL in dev, exported automatically by `dev/load-dev-db.sh`)

**Neon CRM — REST API (server-to-server)**
- `NEON_API_KEY`, `NEON_API_USER` — HTTP Basic auth used by `app/src/lib/helpers/neonHelpers.js` to look up registrants (when a registration webhook fires) and fetch a user's registrations (on `/my-classes`)

**Neon CRM — OAuth 2.0 (WIP user login)**
- `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `REDIRECT_URI` — used by the `/my-classes/login/neon` flow. The OAuth token is parsed as the user's Neon ID and stored on the local `User` row; the app never makes further API calls with it.
- `REDIRECT_URI` must match exactly what's registered with Neon, e.g. `https://classes.asmbly.org/my-classes/login/neon/callback`

**Neon CRM — webhooks**
- `INTERNAL_API_KEY` — shared secret validated on `/api/class-registration` and `/api/class-cancellation`; Neon sends it in the webhook payload's `customParameters`

**Email**
- `GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_PASS` — Gmail account + app password used by `gmailEmailFactory.js` for transactional emails (waitlist openings, private-session requests)

**Newsletter**
- `FLO_API_KEY` — Flodesk API key for the footer newsletter signup

## CI/CD

`.github/workflows/`:

- **`build-and-push.yml`** — on push to `main` touching `app/**`: build linux/amd64 image, push to ECR repo `classes-page` tagged `latest` and `${sha}`, with BuildKit cache pushed to a `buildcache` tag.
- **`build-cron.yml`** — on push to `main` touching `cron-service/**`: build linux/arm64 image, push to ECR repo `classes-cron`, then deploy to Lambda function `classes-crons` via `aws-actions/aws-lambda-deploy@v1.1.0` (timeout 600s).

Both run in `us-east-2` and use AWS credentials from repo secrets.

## Legacy / unused

These root-level files and folders are leftovers from the previous deployment model (docker-compose + Caddy on a single host with self-hosted Postgres). They are not used by the current App Runner setup and can safely be ignored — they're listed here so future contributors know not to follow them as a guide:

- `compose.yaml` — orchestrated app + db + cron + caddy on a single host. Replaced by App Runner (web), Lambda (cron), and RDS (database).
- `compose.dev.yaml` — earlier local-dev setup that ran the app inside a container. Local dev now runs the app on the host via `dev/load-dev-db.sh`.
- `caddy/` — Caddyfile that terminated TLS and reverse-proxied to `app:3000`. App Runner now handles TLS and ingress.
- `hooks.server.js` (repo root) — abandoned scaffolding for a Redis-backed page cache. Never wired into SvelteKit (the live hook is `app/src/hooks.server.js`, which handles auth) and the `redis` dependency was never added to `app/package.json`.
- `postgres_backup.sh` — one-line script that backed up the compose-managed Postgres container by name. Superseded by RDS automated snapshots.
